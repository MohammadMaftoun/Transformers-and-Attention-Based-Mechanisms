# Description
This repository includes examples and tools for using Python to work with transformers and attention-based mechanisms. It supplies scripts and Jupyter notebooks showing how to utilize the Hugging Face Transformers library to work with pre-trained transformer models like BERT. Additionally, it involves examples of applying transformers to tabular data, illustrating the versatility of attention mechanisms in various machine-learning tasks. Transformers are becoming a core part of many neural network architectures, employed in applications such as NLP, tabular data, Speech Recognition, Time Series, and Computer Vision. Transformers have undergone many adaptations and alterations, resulting in newer techniques and methods.
