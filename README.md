# Transformers-and-Attention-Based-Mechanisms
# Description
This repository contains examples and tools for working with transformers and attention-based mechanisms using Python. It provides scripts and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use the Hugging Face Transformers library to work with pre-trained transformer models like BERT. Additionally, it includes examples of applying transformers to tabular data, illustrating the versatility of attention mechanisms in various machine learning tasks.
