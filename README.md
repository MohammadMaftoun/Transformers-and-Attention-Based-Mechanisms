# Description
This repository includes examples and tools for using Python to work with transformers and attention-based mechanisms. It provides scripts and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to use the Hugging Face Transformers library to work with pre-trained transformer models like BERT. Additionally, it includes examples of applying transformers to tabular data, illustrating the versatility of attention mechanisms in various machine-learning tasks. Transformers are becoming a core part of many neural network architectures, employed in a wide range of applications such as NLP, tabular data, Speech Recognition, Time Series, and Computer Vision. Transformers have undergone many adaptations and alterations, resulting in newer techniques and methods.
